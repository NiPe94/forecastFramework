This Forecast Service uses a CSV file - containing a time series dataset - to calculate function models and apply them to a given dataset for computing a new predicted CSV dataset.
This is achieved by providing an MVC-based Application using Maven, Spring Boot, Thymeleaf and Spark with Scala.
Run the ForecastFrameworkApplication class and type in to your browser: "localhost:8080/test" to get access to the formular generated by the server.
